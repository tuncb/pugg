Credits
----
* [nuclex blog](http://blog.nuclex-games.com/tutorials/cxx/plugin-architecture/) for giving me the idea and the basic source code to implement pugg.
* Sebastian (hackspider) for bugfix.
* Szymon Janikowski for fix in old tutorial.
* Alex Elzenaar for code improvements and code for Linux support.

Features
----
* Auto loading of dll files and classes
* Version control for loaded plugins
* Header only library
* OOP Design
* Platform independent

Requirements
-------
* Somewhat current C++ compiler (No C++11 features were used in this version.)

Installation
-----
No installation is required. Files to include are provided in the include folder of the release. On some Linux platforms you need to link with libdl library.

In order to build example projects use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)

Tutorial
-------

Suppose you have an animal class:
~~~~cpp
class Animal
{
public:
    Animal() {}
    virtual ~Animal() {}

    virtual std::string kind() = 0;
    virtual bool can_swim() = 0;
};
~~~~

You want to load subclasses of Animal from dll files.

Add a version and a name to create a server:

~~~~cpp
class Animal
{
public:
    // ....
    static const int version = 1;
    static const std::string server_name() {return "AnimalServer";}
};
~~~~

Then add a driver to tell the name and version of the server to Pugg.

~~~~cpp
class AnimalDriver : public pugg::Driver
{
public:
    AnimalDriver(std::string name, int version) :
        pugg::Driver(Animal::server_name(),name,version) {}
    virtual Animal* create() = 0;
};
~~~~

Now in a separate project create your dll. Lets create a cat and its driver:

~~~~cpp
class Cat : public Animal
{
public:
    std::string kind() {return "Cat";}
    bool can_swim() {return false;}
};

class CatDriver : public AnimalDriver
{
public:
    CatDriver() : AnimalDriver("CatDriver", Cat::version) {}
    Animal* create() {return new Cat();}
};
~~~~
Note that version is the same version from the Animal class at the time Cat is compiled. If Animal class changes in the future and increases its version Cat class will be outdated and won't be loaded by Pugg.


Let's export the Cat class from dll.
~~~~cpp
#include <pugg\Kernel.h>
#include "Cat.h"

#ifdef _WIN32
#  define EXPORTIT __declspec( dllexport )
#else
#  define EXPORTIT
#endif

extern "C" EXPORTIT void register_pugg_plugin(pugg::Kernel* kernel)
{
	kernel->add_driver(new CatDriver());
}
~~~~
*register_pugg_plugin* function is a special function called by Pugg to load drivers from a dll file.

Now in our main app, we can import dlls and have fun
~~~~cpp
#include <pugg\Kernel.h>
#include <Animal.h>

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Loading plugins..." << endl;
    pugg::Kernel kernel;
    kernel.add_server(Animal::server_name(), Animal::version);
#ifdef WIN32
    kernel.load_plugin("PangeaAnimals.dll"); // Cat class is in this dll.
#else
    kernel.load_plugin("libPangeaAnimals.so");
#endif

    // we can load all drivers from a specific server
    vector<AnimalDriver*> drivers =kernel.get_all_drivers<AnimalDriver>(Animal::server_name());
    // to load a specific driver
    // AnimalDriver* animal_driver = kernel.get_driver<AnimalDriver>(Animal::server_name, "CatDriver");
    vector<Animal*> animals;
    for (vector<AnimalDriver*>::iterator iter = drivers.begin(); iter != drivers.end(); ++iter) {
        AnimalDriver& driver = *(*iter);
        animals.push_back(driver.create());
    }

    for(vector<Animal*>::iterator iter = animals.begin(); iter != animals.end(); ++iter) {
        Animal& animal = *(*iter);
        cout << "Animal kind = " << animal.kind() << endl;
        cout << "Can Animal Swim = " << animal.can_swim() << endl;
    }

    for(vector<Animal*>::iterator iter = animals.begin(); iter != animals.end(); ++iter) {
        delete *iter;
    }
}

Class Documentation
-----------
###Driver
Driver class registers user class to Pugg.
~~~~cpp
// /include/pugg/Driver.h
namespace pugg {
class Driver
{
public:
    // server_name : Name of the server driver belongs to.
    // name        : Name of the driver
    // version     : version of the driver
    Driver(std::string server_name, std::string name, int version)
    virtual ~Driver() {}

	std::string server_name() const {return _server_name;}
	std::string name() const {return _name;}
	int version() const {return _version;}
};
}
~~~~

###Kernel
~~~~cpp
// /include/pugg/Kernel.h
namespace pugg {

class Kernel
{
public:
    ~Kernel(); // destroys drivers, servers and links to dll files.
    // loads drivers from the dll file
    bool load_plugin(const std::string& filename);
    // adds a server
    // name               : name of the server
    // min_driver_version : minimum driver version to load to server.
    //                      Lower version drivers are not loaded.
    void add_server(std::string name, int min_driver_version );
    // adds a driver. usually called in the register_pugg_plugin function of dlls.
    bool add_driver(pugg::Driver* driver);

    // gets a specific driver from a server
    template <class DriverType>
    DriverType* get_driver(const std::string& server_name, const std::string& name);
    // gets all drivers from a server
    template <class DriverType>
    std::vector<DriverType*> get_all_drivers(const std::string& server_name);
    // clears all drivers
    void clear_drivers();
    // clears all drivers, servers and plugins
    void clear();
};

}
